												<h2> Our Worship Life </h2>

												<p><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#Be0505">Sunday Worship:<br></span>At Good Shepherd we believe that life is not about us, but Jesus – the One who gave His life for us as He suffered and died and rose again. Because of what Christ has done for us, we join together each week around His Word and Sacraments (Baptism and Lord’s Supper) to worship as a community of believers, giving praise to our one true God: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
We also believe that worship is meant to be part of our everyday life.  And so, making the most of the opportunities God gives us each day to love Him and others, we also desire to live a lifestyle of worship among our family, friends, neighbours, and co-workers.</p>
												<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Worship Time:<br></span><b>Sunday @ 9.30am -- </b> Blended Worship with Traditional and Contemporary styles.
                                Holy Communion is celebrated on each Sunday.</p>
												<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Additional Services:<br></span>Regular involvement of School Chapels at Good Shepherd Lutheran College at various times during School terms.</p>
												<h2 class="imgholder"><img src="content/static/images/altar.jpg" float="center" width="80%" alt="" /></h2>
												<p><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#Be0505">Baptism:<br></span>God’s gift of baptism is available to all people of any age. It is God’s way of joining us to his family and showering upon us his spiritual gifts and blessings. Our pastor is happy to meet with any individuals or families to discuss the process, benefits, joys and responsibilities of being baptised. For more information contact the Church Office on 07 5455 8645.</p>
												<p><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#Be0505">Funerals:<br></span>The loss of a loved one is always a difficult time for families and friends. Those needing support during a time of bereavement, including Christian burial for a loved one, are invited to contact Pastor Mark ( 07 5455 8645) to discuss their situation and needs.</p>
												<p><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#Be0505">Weddings:<br></span>Couples who would like assistance in conducting a Christian wedding service in our church or another venue, or would like to take part in a marriage preparation course, should contact  the Church Office  (07 5455 8645).</p>

												<h4>Regular Electronig Giving (REG)</h4>
												<h2 class="imgholder-col" style="margin-bottom:0"><img src="content/static/images/reg.jpg" width="100%" alt="" /></h2>
												<p>Like some people, you might find it difficult to provide your congregation with a regular offering – for any number of reasons. So, if you are unable to attend church every Sunday, or you are tired of scrambling for cash before church, or you want to be more organised with your giving, REG might be the answer.</p>
												<p>
												<b><i>REG</b></i> is a convenient, safe and confidential <b><i>way of giving a regular offering to your congregation</b></i>.
												REG is facilitated by using the LLL direct debit system. LLL Australia administers REG free of charge as a service to the Lutheran Church of Australia (LCA). View the brochure to see the benefits, or for more information on REG please visit the <a href="https://www.lca.org.au/departments/ministry-support/finance-administration/reg/">LCA website</a>.

											</footer><p>
												To use REG, an <a href="https://www.lll.org.au/files/1279_direct_debit_request.pdf?v=633">LLL Direct Debit Request Form</a> must be completed and lodged with the LLL. Also read the <a href="https://www.lll.org.au/files/18_direct_debit_request_service_agreement.pdf?v=970">Service Agreement</a> before you send the completed form to the LLL. This form gives the LLL authority to deduct the amount you specify from your LLL account or your account with a financial institution, and transfer it to an LLL REG account held by the organisation to which you are giving.
												​</p><p>
												Brochure and cards are available from your local LCA district office or by contacting the <a href="https://www.lll.org.au/contact">LLL</a>.

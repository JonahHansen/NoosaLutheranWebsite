                  <h4>History of our Congregation</h4>
                  <p>Good Shepherd Lutheran Church in Noosa started in 1985.
                    Until then Noosa Lutherans formed part of the Gympie parish
                    which included a congregation in Cooroy. Neil Berlin, a
                    Lutheran lay mission worker, did some groundwork in the
                    Noosa area in the early 1980s and found that there was
                    support for the establishment of a Christian school in the
                    area. In 1985 the former Noosa drive-in theatre on Eumundi
                    Road in Noosaville came up for sale and was purchased by the
                    Lutheran Church as the centre for a church and a school. A
                    new Cooroy-Noosa Lutheran parish was formed and the drive-in
                    kiosk converted to a preaching place. Good Shepherd Lutheran
                    Primary School opened in 1986, added a classroom block and
                    shared the existing facilities with the congregation. In
                    1991 the congregation built the current church on the
                    campus. Meanwhile the school was growing and became a P – 12
                    college in 1992. Pastor Keith Stiller served as the first
                    pastor to the Noosa and Cooroy congregations. He was
                    succeeded in due course by Pastor Chris Bartholomaeus,
                    Pastor Mark Nitschke, and currently Pastor Mark Hansen.</p>
                 <p>In 2021, Good Shepherd added on to the current facilities a new worship and ministry centre.  This consists of a new Chapel for worship, offices, kitchen, a fellowship terrace and multipurpose room.  We are excited to see how God will use these facilities to help us grow in our faith and to encourage others to know God’s love and grace.   These facilities are made available by a generous gift from the Holtz estate and in partnership with Good Shepherd Lutheran College</p>

                  <h4>Our Organisation</h4>
                  <p>The Good Shepherd Lutheran congregation in Noosa belongs to
                    the Lutheran Church of Australia (LCA). It is also part of
                    the regional organisation known as the Lutheran Church of
                    Australia, Queensland District (LCAQD). It financially
                    supports both the national and regional entities of the
                    Church and accepts and co-operates with their initiatives in
                    areas like missions, education and welfare. Good Shepherd
                    also has considerable local autonomy, calling its own
                    pastors, electing its own officers, establishing its own
                    committees, setting its own budget and establishing its own
                    program. The congregation works under a constitution. The
                    Church Council has oversight of the work of the
                    congregation, which includes a chair, treasurer and
                    indexary. Various committees are formed to provide for
                    areas of purpose including; worship, fellowship,
                    discipleship, evangelism and ministry (pastoral care). </p>

								<h4> Why do the FAITH 5? </h4>
								<p>​This is a simple tool every household can use every night. You could do this with your friend from church, grandkids in another state or the people your consider family.  Every age and stage of life can do FAITH5 together as a way to grow deeper in their own discipleship. You will also get to know God's Word in a new way and create lasting faith connections with the people you care most about. <br> <br>
								Check out the video below of our friend, Dr Rich Melheim who shares about the Faith 5.  </p>

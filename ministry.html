								<p><b><span style="color:#00bc00">Pastor's Classes<br></span></b>
								Each year our pastor conducts a course which explains the Christian faith and the Lutheran understanding in particular. The aims are to give a global perspective on the Bible, faith and God, answer some of the big questions people have, and maybe make some new friendships over coffee. For further information contact  the Church Office (07 5455 8645).
								</p>
								<p><b><span style="color:#00bc00">Faith Mile Stones<br></span></b>
									Several times a year our men meet for a special fellowship. This is generally over a BBQ meal with gourmet foods supplied. A guest speaker presenting an interesting and challenging topic is often part of this gathering. Our members are encouraged to invite their friends and associates to join us in our informal gatherings, to add to the dynamics of meeting other menfolk who are not associated with our congregation. Each Men’s Night is advertised in the Sunday Bulletin. For further information on men's activities please contact Graeme Handreck (5471 0475).
